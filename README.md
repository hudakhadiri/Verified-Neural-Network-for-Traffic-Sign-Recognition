# Verified-Neural-Network-for-Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Developed and verified a neural network for traffic sign recognition using Frama-C and ACSL. Translated the model into C and specified safety properties. Tested robustness with FGSM attacks, validated using Z3 and Alt-Ergo SMT solvers, and applied Why3 for theorem proving on critical properties
